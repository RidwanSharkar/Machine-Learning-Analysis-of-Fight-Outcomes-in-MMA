**Predictive Analysis of Fight Outcomes in Mixed Martial Arts Using Machine Learning**

Overview:This project attempts to predict the outcomes of MMA fights based on a diverse set of attributes sourced from historical fight data, consisting of fighter statistics, historical performance, physical attributes, and fighting styles to train a predictive model based on Random Forest. The goal is to see if an accurate prediction of a novel fight can be determined from a vast set of fighter attributes. WIP
